LpqN case study:

Three cosolvent simulation were performed with different conditions and a config.json and the proper cosovlent.json were created for each condition:
	- no cosolvent: config_LpqN.json 
	- n-hexane: config_LpqN_HEX.json
	- n-pentane: config_LpqN_PEN.json

Each condition can be replicated by running the following command within the case study's folder in a proper and activated conda environment (see the installation instructions):
	prepare_cosolvent_system -c <config_of_interest.json>

NPC2 case study:

Three cosolvent simulation were performed with different conditions and a config.json and the proper cosovlent.json were created for each condition:
	- no cosolvent: config_NPC2.json 
	- tert-butane: config_NPC2_BUT.json
	- naphthalene: config_NPC2_NAP.json

Each condition can be replicated by running the following command within the case study's folder in a proper and activated conda environment (see the installation instructions):
	prepare_cosolvent_system -c <config_of_interest.json>}
